# 12V-DC-DC-Power-Supply-Solution

*	Built a DC-DC 12V power supply solution that has 2 output voltage rails which utilizes 1 SMPS and 2 LDO regulators.
*	Created first 1.8V output rail at 1A max for analog/RF circuits and reduced voltage noise to less than 20uVrms.
*	Developed the second 3.3V output rail for digital circuits at 1.5A Max and minimized output ripple to less than 5mVpp.
